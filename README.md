Project Overview: Evaluating AI Models for Effectiveness
Objective: The primary goal of this project is to implement and compare various AI models to evaluate their performance in solving a specific problem. This involves using appropriate datasets, applying different machine learning algorithms, and utilizing relevant evaluation metrics to determine the effectiveness of each model.

Steps Involved:
Dataset Selection and Preparation:

Identify and select a relevant dataset.
Preprocess the data: handle missing values, encode categorical variables, normalize/standardize features, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Implementation:

Implement multiple AI models (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Means Clustering, Logistic Regression, SVM).
Train each model on the training dataset.
Make predictions on the testing dataset.
Evaluation Metrics:

Choose appropriate evaluation metrics based on the problem type (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score for classification; mean squared error, RÂ² for regression).
Calculate and record the performance metrics for each model.
Comparison and Analysis:

Compare the performance of the models using the chosen metrics.
Analyze the results to determine which model performs best for the given problem.
Identify potential overfitting or underfitting by comparing training and testing performance.
Visualization:

Visualize the performance of the models using plots (e.g., confusion matrix, ROC curves, scatter plots for regression).
Visualize the decision boundaries for classification models to understand how they separate different classes.
